                Smith Wigglesworth was born on 10 June 1859[1] in Menston, Yorkshire, England, to an impoverished family. 
                As a small child, he worked in the fields pulling turnips alongside his mother; he also worked in factories 
                to help provide for his family. He was illiterate as a child, being unschooled because of his labours.

                Nominally a Methodist, he became a born again Christian at the age of eight. His grandmother was a devout
                 Methodist; his parents, John and Martha, took young Smith to Methodist and Anglican churches on regular 
                 occasions. He was confirmed by a Bishop in the Church of England, baptized by immersion in a Baptist 
                 church and had grounding in Bible teaching in the Plymouth Brethren while learning the plumbing trade 
                 as an apprentice from a man in the Brethren movement
