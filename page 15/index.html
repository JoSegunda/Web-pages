                Smith Wigglesworth was born on 10 June 1859[1] in Menston, Yorkshire, England, to an impoverished family. 
                As a small child, he worked in the fields pulling turnips alongside his mother; he also worked in factories 
                to help provide for his family. He was illiterate as a child, being unschooled because of his labours.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nominally a Methodist,   he became a born again Christian at the age of eight. His grandmother was a devout
                 Methodist; his parents, John and Martha, took young Smith to Methodist and Anglican churches on regular 
                 occasions. He was confirmed by a Bishop in the Church of England, baptized by immersion in a Baptist 
                 church and had grounding in Bible teaching in the Plymouth Brethren while learning the plumbing trade 
                 as an apprentice from a man in the Brethren movement.

                Wigglesworth believed that healing came through faith, and he was flexible in his approach. 
                When he was forbidden to lay hands on audience members by the authorities in Sweden, he preached 
                for a "corporate healing", by which people laid hands on themselves. He also practiced anointing with oil, 
                and the distribution of "prayer handkerchiefs" (one of which was sent to King George V). Wigglesworth sometimes 
                attributed ill-health to demons.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wigglesworth largely believed his ministerial success was due to his Baptism with the Holy Spirit. He said: <br>
                <cite>
                    I want you to see that he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself or builds himself up. 
                    We must be edified before we can edify the church. I cannot estimate what I, personally, owe to the 
                    Holy Ghost method of spiritual edification. <mark>I am here before you as one of the biggest conundrums in the world. 
                    There never was a weaker man on the platform. Language? None. Inability-full of it. All natural things in my life 
                    point exactly opposite to my being able to stand on the platform and preach the gospel.</mark> The secret is that the Holy 
                    Ghost came and brought this wonderful edification of the Spirit. I had been reading this Word continually as well as 
                    I could, but the Holy Ghost came and took hold of it, for the Holy Ghost is the breath of it, and He illuminated it
                     to me.
